- In JavaScript, fetch() is a built-in function that allows you to make HTTP requests to a server and retrieve data in a format such as JSON, text, HTML, or Blob. The fetch() function returns a Promise that resolves to the server's response.

- The syntax for using fetch() is straightforward. You simply pass the URL of the resource you want to retrieve as an argument to the function. You can also pass an optional second argument that configures the request, such as specifying the request method, headers, or body.

- Here's an example that demonstrates how to use fetch() to retrieve data from an API endpoint:

```js
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```
